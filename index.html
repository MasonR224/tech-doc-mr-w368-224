            <header>Introduction</header>
              <p>Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is a tactical first-person shooter that requires a mix of skill, strategy, and team coordination. The game is centered around two teams: the Terrorists (T-side), who aim to plant a bomb, and the Counter-Terrorists (CT-side), who aim to prevent the bomb from being planted or defuse it after a plant. Players must master both individual skills and teamwork to succeed.</p>

              <p>CS2 offers several game modes, each designed for different types of gameplay:
                <ul>
                  <li>Competitive Mode: The main mode, where two teams of five players each battle to win rounds by planting or defusing the bomb.</li>
                  <li>Casual Mode: A less intense version of competitive mode with more forgiving mechanics.</li>
                  <li>Deathmatch Mode: Focused on improving shooting accuracy by respawning players continuously.</li>
                  <li>Arms Race: A fun mode where players progress through a series of weapons by getting kills.</li>
                  <li>Wingman: A 2v2 mode focusing on fast-paced bomb plant/defuse rounds.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

              <p>The primary objective of CS2 is to either plant or defuse a bomb, depending on your side. Here are the core mechanics:
                <ul>
                  <li>Bomb Planting: Terrorists win by planting the bomb at one of the two bomb sites (A or B) and protecting it until it detonates.</li>
                  <li>Bomb Defusing: Counter-Terrorists win by either eliminating the opposing team or defusing the bomb after it’s been planted.</li>
                  <li>Round Time: Each round is limited to a set time, and players must act quickly and efficiently.</li>
                  <li>Economy: The money system impacts your ability to purchase weapons and utility, making round-winning critical for gaining the upper hand.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

            <header>Gunplay and Weapon Strategies</header>
              <p>Gunplay is the heart of Counter-Strike. The effectiveness of your weapons depends on your aim, positioning, and knowledge of each weapon’s characteristics.
    Common Weapons and Usage:
                <ul>
                  <li>AK-47 (T-side): High damage and accuracy, ideal for one-tap headshots. Use for mid-to-long-range engagements.</li>
                  <li>M4A4/M4A1-S (CT-side): Great for accurate, controlled shots. Effective at mid-range.</li>
                  <li>AWP: The sniper rifle that can kill with one shot to the chest or head. Use for long-range holding and mid control.</li>
                  <li>Pistols: Quick and accurate, often used in pistol rounds. Familiarize yourself with Desert Eagle and USP-S for headshots.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Movement_and_Positioning">
            <header>Movement and Positioning</header>
              <p>Effective movement is crucial in CS2, as it allows players to both position themselves strategically and avoid getting caught in vulnerable situations.
    Movement Tips:
                <ul>
                  <li>Walking: Move silently by holding Shift. Ideal for sneaking past enemy positions.</li>
                  <li>Running: Run to cover large distances quickly, but be aware that you make noise and reveal your position.</li>
                  <li>Jumping: Use to avoid headshots when peeking, but jumping too often makes you an easy target.</li>
                  <li>Peeking: Practice "counter-strafe peeking" to make quick, accurate shots while exposing minimal body.</li>
                </ul>

          <section class="main-section" id="Utility_Usage">
            <header>Utility Usage</header>
              <p>Utility items can change the outcome of a round. Knowing when and how to use them effectively is key to controlling the flow of the game.
    Common Utility Items:
                <ul>
                  <li>Flashbangs: Temporarily blind enemies to gain the upper hand in a fight. Use them to flush out enemies or initiate pushes.</li>
                  <li>Smoke Grenades: Block sightlines and choke points. Use them to obscure enemy vision during a site push.</li>
                  <li>Molotovs/Incendiaries: Block paths and force enemies out of cover by creating fire zones.</li>
                  <li>Decoy Grenades: Create misleading noise and radar blips to confuse enemies.</li>
                  <li>High-Explosive Grenade (HE Grenade): Deals explosive damage over a small area, ideal for weakening enemies or forcing them out of cover.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

            <header>Map Analysis</header>
              <p>Understanding map layouts and choke points is essential for controlling areas and executing strategies.
    Key Maps in CS2:
                <ul>
                  <li>Dust 2: Simple, fast-paced map focused on long A, mid, and B site.</li>
                  <li>Inferno: Narrow chokepoints, requiring good use of banana and apartments.</li>
                  <li>Mirage: Central mid control and A/B splits; versatile with multiple strategies.</li>
                  <li>Nuke: Vertical combat with a focus on controlling upper and lower bomb sites.</li>
                  <li>Overpass: Key control of mid, waterway, and connector for both teams.</li>
                </ul>

              <p>The Terrorist team needs to work together to either plant the bomb or eliminate all Counter-Terrorists. 
    Key Strategies for T-Side:
                <ul>
                  <li>A Split: Attack A site from both T ramp and mid for a two-pronged push.</li>
                  <li>B Split: Push through banana and apartments to overwhelm the B site.</li>
                  <li>Default Setup: Spread out across the map to gather information, then choose a site to push based on the enemy’s positioning.</li>
                </ul>

            <header>Strategies for Counter-Terrorists (CT-Side)</header>
              <p>The Counter-Terrorists must defend the bomb sites or retake them after a plant.
    Key Strategies for CT-Side:
                <ul>
                  <li>Aggressive Mid Control: Push mid to gain control of the central map area, which can block T-side rotations.</li>
                  <li>Bombsite Hold: Hold A site with pit, balcony, and fountain; hold B site with banana and ct spawn.</li>
                  <li>Retakes: When retaking a bombsite, use smokes and flashes to disorient the enemy while pushing as a team.</li>
                </ul>

            <header>Aiming and Crosshair Placement</header>
              <p>Proper aiming and crosshair placement can improve your accuracy and reaction time.
    Tips for Accurate Aiming:
                <ul>
                  <li>Head Level Placement: Always keep your crosshair at head level for quicker headshots.</li>
                  <li>Pre-aiming: Anticipate common enemy positions and pre-aim at those locations as you approach.</li>
                  <li>Spray Control: Learn the spray patterns of different guns, especially the AK-47 and M4A4, to ensure more accurate shots when spraying.</li>

              <p>Sound is a critical part of CS2, and being able to hear enemy movements gives you a huge advantage.
    Important Audio Cues:
                <ul>
                  <li>Footsteps: Different surfaces create distinct sounds, allowing you to pinpoint enemy movement.</li>
                  <li>Reloading: Listen for the sound of an enemy reloading to predict their next move.</li>
                  <li>Bomb Planting: The sound of a bomb being planted can be used to predict where the enemy will push.</li>
                </ul>

              <p>Avoiding common mistakes can make the difference between victory and defeat.
    Common Mistakes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Poor Economy Management: Don’t overspend on weapons when the team needs utility or armor.</li>
                  <li>Lack of Communication: Not sharing information or callouts can lead to confusion and missed opportunities.</li>
                  <li>Overextending: Don’t peek aggressively or overcommit to fights without backup, especially when you have an advantage.</li>
